## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use @media properly and mobile-first approach.

I also learned how to change one picture for another while changing screen width. 
`````html
<picture>
      <source srcset='images/image-product-desktop.jpg'
    media='(min-width: 550px)'/>
     <img src='images/image-product-mobile.jpg'/>
    </picture>
`````````````

### Continued development

I have to develope learned skills like changing layout with screen width.

### Useful resources

While working on the project I was on 21-days cours 'Conquering Responsive Layouts' by K. Powell, which was very helpful:
